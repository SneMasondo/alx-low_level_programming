# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains C programming exercises designed to help you improve your understanding of low-level programming concepts.

The project involves learning how to compile C code, handle system-level operations, and follow strict coding styles (Betty style). The exercises will take place on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system with the gcc compiler.

## Compilation and Style

All files are compiled using the following gcc options:
- `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
